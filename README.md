## Project Concept:
We intend to make a pantry tracker which lets the user enter and view their pantry contents as well as feature an online cookbook which recommends dishes to the user using the available ingredients in the user's pantry.

##How to use the Pantry app
Clone this repository on your system using `git clone https://github.com/an-siuu-man/348-Semester-Project`, or you could simply download `shelfsmart.exe` in the `backend/` folder and run it. It will offer you some options and how to select them. This is the terminal version of the app.

Secondly, we also have GUI version of the app, but unfortunately we weren't able to implement the GUI in C++. In order to run the GUI version, you would need to clone the repo on your system, then navigate to your clone directory in the terminal and run the following commands:
`cd pantryfrontend`
`npm install`
`npm start`

Then navigate to (localhost:3000) on a web browser and you will see the results! The GUI is very simple and self-explanatory to the user. Happy cooking!
